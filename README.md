Calculator Project (Unfinished)

This is my first personal project. In this project I practice using a Makefile, uploading to GitHub, and working with Windows GUI/API library to create a simple calculator application.  

I put notes throughout the files in repo so that I can look back upon it
I explore creating a simple windows application in here as well as other
fun new things! Refer back to here in the future!!
