Calculator Project

This is my first personal project. In this project I practice using a Makefile, uploading to GitHub, and working with multiple files to create a simple calculator application. 

a.exe is the executable code for the application. 

I put notes throughout the files in repo so that I can look back upon it
I explore creating a simple windows application in here as well as other
fun new things! Refer back to here in the future!!
